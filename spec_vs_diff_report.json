  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of requirements: REQ-8 (Heavenuse rebranding), REQ-9 (backend chat model and API), REQ-10 (GroupChatPage), REQ-11 (MediaGallery), and REQ-12 (member display names). Nearly all acceptance criteria appear to be addressed. Minor gaps exist around polling (refetchInterval) evidence in the diff and member-list display on the group page, but file summaries confirm polling hooks and MemberDisplayName component exist. Overall implementation is comprehensive.",
